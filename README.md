+Helping business owners get fast answers to basic questions about City of San Jose permitting.
+
+This is a City of San Jose project. The goal is to develop a working prototype by June 1. 
+
+See the low-fidelity visual prototype in progress here: https://app.moqups.com/mthong/JbeLlcqAjX/view
+ 
+The user (a prospective business owner) provides 2 pieces of information to start:
+(1) The type of business (selects from a drop down list)
+(2) The address of the business
+
+Using that information, the tool must look at the zoning and other property information for the address, and consult a look-up table to determine if the desired business type is allowed in that location. 
+
+Next, the tool asks the user a series of questions about the scope of construction work. E.g. Are you making interior changes? Will there be changes to the sidewalk, etc? Based on these answers, the tool will determine what types of permits are needed. 
+
+For questions, please contact Michelle Thong, San Jose Office of Civic Innovation at michelle.thong@sanjoseca.gov.
